# Pose estimation

The goal to generate a 6D pose estimate for the robot.

## My approach to solution

### Environment setup

I followed the steps in this [link](https://semfire-core.slite.com/p/note/JfJtfmdjUWv2XBJTTA1yKH) to setup the environment and required packages.

**Note:** I had the following error:

```
[ERROR] [1627814098.645725029]: PluginlibFactory: The plugin for class 'rviz_plugin_tutorials/Imu' failed to load.
```

I solved it by installing the following package:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-rviz-plugin-tutorials
```

Then I run ros bag using the following command:

```
roslaunch semfire_dataset_ntu run_dataset.launch
```

### Check the rosbag

```

After checking the available sensors and the data they provide, I decided to do kalman filter to build to estimate
the position and pose of the robot. I used the data provided by the Imu sensor.

#### Imu /imu/data

```
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
  float64 w
float64[9] orientation_covariance
geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular_velocity
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
float64[9] angular_velocity_covariance
geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear_acceleration
  float64 x
  float64 y
  float64 z
float64[9] linear_acceleration_covariance
```

### Kalman Filter

I decided to use the kalman filter library [FilterPy](https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
This library was written in conjunction with the book [Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)

We need to define the matrices required for Kalman filter and the library handle the computation in two
methods `predict` and `update` which do the equation multiplication and give the new state.

#### Matrices design

Starting with the main equation `X = Fx + Bu`
The first matrix is the state matrix, which define the states we want to track.
In our problem we want to track the position and pose of the robot. The matrix will look like this

##### State matrix X

`X = [x, y, z, ddx, ddy, ddz, R, P, Y]`. where the first three elements represent the position 
and `ddx, ddy, ddz` represent the acceleration. We added the linear acceleration to the states to make use
of the acceleration provided by the IMU sensor. The last three `R, P, Y` represent the orientation of 
the robot in euler angles.

##### State transition matrix F

It will be a 9x9 matrix which is multiplied by the states to compute the prior.

```
F = 
[[1.   0.   0.   (0.5 * self.dt**2) 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   1.   0.   0.   (0.5 * self.dt**2) 0.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   1.   0.   0.   (0.5 * self.dt**2) 0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   1.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   0.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   0.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   1.   0.  ]
 [0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   1.  ]]
```

Where `dt` is the time step which is substituted by 0.2 after checking the different between two consecutive
time stamps of the IMU messages.

##### The state variance matrix P

```
P = 
[[ 50.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.  50.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.  50.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0. 100.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0. 100.   0.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0.   0. 100.   0.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   5.   0.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   5.   0.]
 [  0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   5.]]
```

This matrix represent the uncertainty we have in our state. We assumed that our states are not correlated
so all the elements of the diagonal are set to zero. The higher the values the more uncertainty
we have in the states. We specify an initial value for P and the Kalman filter updates it goes.

##### The measurement noise covariance R

For the Imu sensor we have the covariance matrix provided for the linear acceleration and the orientation

```
R = 
[[0.0015387262937311438, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0.0015387262937311438, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0.0015387262937311438, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0.002741552146694444, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0.002741552146694444, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.007615422629706791]]
```

##### The process noise Q

This matrix is represent the process noise and one on its function to keep the process vairance `P` from
going to zero. We assumed it to be zero for simplicity.

### Code Implementation

The kalman filter is implemented in `kal.py` and the ros node in `listener.py`

The ros node do two main functions subscribe to the `/imu/data` topic to get the sensor's reading
do a kalman filter iteration to get the new states then publish a transform between the `world` frame
and the robot base frame which contain the new position of the robot.

### Code explanation

For the Kalman filter it is pretty straight forward

``` python
self.robot_filter = KalmanFilter(dim_x=9, dim_z=6)    # Filter object
```

We create a KalmanFilter object and then start to assign our matrices to it as follows:

```python
def create_filter(self):
      self.robot_filter.x = self.x
      self.robot_filter.F = np.identity(9)
      self.robot_filter.F[0,3] = 0.5 * self.dt**2
      self.robot_filter.F[1,4] = 0.5 * self.dt**2
      self.robot_filter.F[2,5] = 0.5 * self.dt**2
      
      self.robot_filter.H[:] = self.h
      self.robot_filter.R[:]= self.R
      self.robot_filter.P[:] = self.p
      self.robot_filter.Q[:]= self.q
```

**Note:** I decided to make it in a class structure so when imported in the ros node no variable name
conflict take place

For the ros node `listener.py`

```python
# Create the kalman filter
km = kalman_matrix()
km.create_filter()
```

We created an instance of our class, and called the `create_filter()` to assign the matrices

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)
    rospy.Subscriber("/imu/data", Imu, Imu_callback)
    rospy.spin()
```

Jumping to the main, We initialized the node, created a subscriber, used the `rospy.spin()` to keep the
node up and handle callbacks

In the callback of the `/imu/data` topic `Imu_callback`

```python
orientation_q = [data.orientation.x, data.orientation.y, data.orientation.z, data.orientation.w]
euler_angles = euler_from_quaternion(orientation_q)
reading = np.array([data.linear_acceleration.x, data.linear_acceleration.y, data.linear_acceleration.z,
                euler_angles[0], euler_angles[1], euler_angles[2]])
```

We convert the readings from quaternion to euler and then we have the `reading` array which repesent
the measurement matrix in our kalman filter

```python
km.robot_filter.predict()
km.robot_filter.update(reading)
```

then we do the `predict` which calculate the prior, followed by the `update` which take the measurement
to compute the new states. Note: these methods update the states internally.

```python
br = TransformBroadcaster()

quat = quaternion_from_euler(*km.robot_filter.x[6:])
quat = quat/np.linalg.norm(quat)
br.sendTransform(km.robot_filter.x[0:3], quat, data.header.stamp, "bobcat_base", "World")
```

We created a transform broadcaster object which will send a transformation between a fixed `World` frame
and our robot base frame. The `sendTransform` fuction gets the rotation in quaternion so that's why
we converted the angles from euler to quaternion.
the send transform takes the translation, orientation, time stamp, the child frame and the parent frame.

In rviz you can change the Fixed frame to World to see the robot moving with respect to this frame
